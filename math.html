    <h2>Number Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Exponents and Exponent Rules</h3>
    <p class="sectionp">Earlier this year, we dove deep into the concept of exponents, with many different types being included.</p>
    <div class="imgbox">

    <p class="sectionp">Zero Exponents - the idea of using zero exponents essentially means that a number is being multiplied by itself 0 times, making it undefined. This leaves us with an answer of one, regardless of the number being raised to a power In the first image above, the practice shows my demonstration of zero exponents used in direct questions, as well as expressions using zero exponents.<br><br>Negative Exponents - in order to solve an expression with a negative exponent, you can convert the value into 1 over the product of the raised number. The second image has examples of me doing so, as well as related questions and tables with negative exponents. This topic allowed us to really break down the meaning of certain exponents and use it to solve raised numbers.<br><br>The third image includes all the rules for exponents we have gone over, as well as some questions with them in use. In class we learnt how to identify the type of exponent expression and use the rulesheet attached to solve them. Overall I was able to learn all different types of exponent equations and was able to put them into use with word problems and practice on the final image.</p>

    <h3>Percentages</h3>

    <p class="sectionp">Percentages are a simple way of expressing a part of a whole number. They can be converted to other forms, such as decimals and fractions.</p>
    
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Percentages/20240408_202301.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Percentages/20240408_202401.jpg">
    </div>

    <p class="sectionp">The main method we used in class to solve percent problems is to convert percentages to decimals. This is done by simply taking the percentage and putting it behind a decimal point, e.g. 75% = 0.75. After converting the percentage, it allows us to have a easier value to work with, where we can simply multiply the decimal by a number to find the answer. In this case, we'd multiply 0.75 by the number we want to find 75% of. The images attached contain examples of this learning in use.</p>

    <h3>Ratios</h3>

    <p class="sectionp">Ratios are similar to fractions, but also act as a rate for something. E.g. every 2 children in the room, there are 4 adults (2:4).</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Ratios/20240408_201456.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Ratios/20240408_201546.jpg">
    </div>

    <p class="sectionp">The above images contain some examples of ratios used in real life. An example from the first page is lisa burning 120 calories in 8 minutes. If we convert this into a ratio/rate we get 8:120 signifiying that every 8 minutes passed, Lisa will burn 120 calories. The same can be done for Mario in this example to be able to compare the calories burnt of both athletes. Ratios may also be used as rates. The second image gives us an idea of how we can use ratios in real life, an example being gas prices by the litre.</p>

    <h3>Rates</h3>

    <p class="sectionp">The main focus on rates was on unit rates, this may be the cost of one item in a bundle for example. In class, we have gone over multiple worksheets to solve for unit rates. Unit rates can also be expressed as a ratio of sort, and can be used to find cost of more items, etc.

      <div class="imgbox">
        <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Rates/20240408_201816.jpg">
        <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Rates/20240408_201840.jpg">
        <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Rates/20240408_202048.jpg">
        <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Rates/20240408_202125.jpg">
      </div>

    <p class="sectionp">Unit rates are fairly simple to solve. In the first image, we have an example with 6 boxes of Kleenex for $15.90. In order to find the unit rate, we need to find the cost of one box. To do this, we multiply the price by the amount of boxes, in this case 15.9/6, leaving us with the answer of $2.65/box.<br><br>When it comes to finding unit rates in tables, the method to use is to find the difference between each value, e.g. if x = 1, and y = 2 and then x turns into 2 and y turns into 4, we will know that the unit rate is 2x.</p>
    
    <h3>Proportions</h3>

    <p class="sectionp">This topic requires knowledge of ratios, as it is an expansion on that topic. Solving proportion questions are essentially converting multiple ratios into one that can be used to compare.</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Proportions/20240408_201328.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Proportions/20240408_201410.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Proportions/20240408_201622.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Proportions/20240408_201703.jpg">
      <img src="Images/Portfolio Number Concepts/Proportions/20240408_201943.jpg">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sectionp">The images shown above are practice questions including 2 and 3 term proportions.<br><br>2 term proportions - in order to compare 2 ratios, the denominatior must be equal on both ratios. In order to convert this, we must find the lowest common denomintor between the ratios. While converting, we must ensure that the same operation is also applied to the numerator. An example of this entire process would be having ratios such as 2:3 and 5:6 which is then converted to 4:6 and 5:6. In this case, 6 was the lowest denominator. After converting the compared ratios, we may determine the larger ratio, add them, etc. The last 4 images contain examples and questions with this topic.<br><br>3 term proportions - with 3 terms, the concept remains, except the common denominator must be common between all 3 ratios. An example of this is 2:3, 4:6 and 7:9, which can be converted to 6:9, 6:9 and 7:9 with 9 being the lowest common denominator. More examples of this is included in the first 2 images.</p>

  <h3>Scientific Notation</h3>
  <p>Scientific notation is used for simplifying extremely large or small numbers using exponents.<br><br>Let's take 13 000 as an example. It's a very large number to work with. First we remove the 3 zeros and remain with 13, which will be converted to 1.3 as scientific notation cannot exceed 9. Our formula is now 1.3 x 10, which we need to add exponents to. Because we removed 3 zeros earlier, we cube 10.<br><br>Our final answer is 1.3 x 10^3. Much shorter and easy to read. We can check our answer by solving this statement.<br><br>Scientific notation can deal with smaller numbers too. Our example here will be 0.0023. Like before, we'll take the 3 zeros away as well as the decimal point and convert to 2.3. In order to find the exponent here, we'll cube 10 again as there were 3 zeros removed; an important step is to ensure that the cubing is negative, as we need the 10 to get smaller when cubed. Our final answer would be 2.3 x 10^-3 which again would give us our starting value if solved.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p class="sectionp">In math class, the main coding language we focused on is Python. Python is a object oriented, human readable programming language. Python is great for multipurpose and data management solutions, as well as being easy to learn for beginners.<br><br>The project I created in class is a unit converter that automatically converts given metric or imperial units to its opposite value.<br><br>Below is the code I used for this project, as well as some comments to explain the code.<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/104j41BisLemZUAn2nvN4fNvvnoDWilQrToT_21XAQNE/edit?usp=sharing">Click here!</a> - Link to code has been provided for decluttering purposes.<br><br>Below is an example of possible input and output.
